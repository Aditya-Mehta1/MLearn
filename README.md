# MLearn
Mlearn is an AI powered handwriting recognition tool I developed in a span of 12 hours with a team of my friends.
The project aims to help aspiring english learners practice writing in English. 
The project involves pre-processing of data and then training it through a random forest classifier, which makes a prediction on which letter it could be with an accuracy of ~ 90%
